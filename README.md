# CKD-GEO: A Multimodal Workflow for Predicting Chronic Kidney Disease Using Public Mortality and Geospatial Data

## üîç Project Overview

**CKD-GEO** is a multimodal machine learning (mML) pipeline that integrates publicly available **mortality records** and **geospatial data** to predict **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** in the Mexican state of **Jalisco**. This project demonstrates the feasibility of using administrative and statistical data for health surveillance through machine learning and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI).

## üß† Objectives

- Develop and evaluate a machine learning pipeline using **publicly available mortality and spatial data**.
- Apply **SHAP** and **LIME** for model explainability.
- Identify **demographic** and **geographic** factors associated with CKD mortality in Jalisco.
- Provide a **reproducible baseline** for health informatics research using open data.
