## CKD-GEO Project description



This notebook presents the development and evaluation of machine learning models for the prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using structured mortality and geospatial data. The project is part of a scientific study exploring the application of supervised learning and model interpretability techniques to analyze patient data and extract insights into the risk factors associated with CKD in the population of Jalisco, Mexico.

⚠️ Disclaimer:
This model is not intended for clinical use or medical diagnosis. It was developed strictly for scientific and educational purposes to explore the capabilities and limitations of machine learning in health informatics research. The predictions made by the model should not be used to guide real-world medical decisions.
